# Random access of DNA storage using nanopore sequencer
In comparison to conventional media, DNA has the advantages of high storage density and long service life. Data must be translated into short DNA sequences for storage due to the limits of DNA storage technology. To index short DNA sequences, however, a great amount of physical redundancy will be produced in the process. To reduce redundancy, we have proposed DNA storage encoding scheme with hidden addressing.Â  The index substitutes some of the data to realise hidden addresses using the modified fountain encoding approach, and the file is subsequently encoded with the hidden addressing. This suggested encoding method can increase base utilisation while also guaranteeing the proper rate of DNA storage during sequencing and decoding process.
